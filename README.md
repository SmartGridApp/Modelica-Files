Please extract the "MicroGrid.tar.gz" file from the repository and from the extracted file, load the 'MicroGrid' library in OMEdit. And to find microgrid circuit browse to MicroGrid>Grid>ThreePhase>MicroGrid_Layout_2 (for 3 phase model) and 
MicroGrid>Grid>OnePhase>MicroGrid_Layout_1 (for one phase model).

Note: As we have re-modeled the loads there is some issues with the circuit breaker, we are looking into it and we will update them once they are completed. So in the one phase grid circuit, we havn't included the circuit breaker.
